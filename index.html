    <img src="images/assassins-creed.jpg" alt="Picture of 7 of the assassins">

    <h2>Premise</h2>
    <p>The Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict
        between two ancient secret societies: the Order of Assassins, who represents freedom,
        and the Knights Templar, who represents order. Versions of these societies have existed
        for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of
        pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people.</p>

    <h2>The Franchise</h2>
    <p>As of 2023 there are 13 Main games along with a number of smaller games meant for Phones
        and Nintendo Ds type consoles. There is also currently one live action film.
    </p>

    <h2>Graphical and Gameplay Changes</h2>
    <p>After the 9th installment assassins creed syndiate, the 10th installment was changed
        dramatically into a rpg style with the release of AC Origins, followed by Odyssey and Valhalla
        However in 2023 Ubisoft went back to basics releasing the 13th installment AC Mirage as a
        back to basics stealth type game after years of debate.
